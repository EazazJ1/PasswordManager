## About

Created a password manager to save usernames and passwords securely.<br /><br />
Usernames and Passwords are Encrypted and/or Hashed before being saved to the database.<br />
I have also used NGINX and SSL Certificates to encrypt the connection between the clients and the server.





## Tools
Node.js, React.js, MongoDB, Express, NGINX, Docker
